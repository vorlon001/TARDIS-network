Service registry and discovery in Golang Cloud-Native microservice with Consul and Docker
=========================================================================================

### [](#Background "Background")Background

In this post, I will give a real demo application to show how to do service registration and discovery in `Cloud-Native` microservice architecture based on `Consul` and `Docker`. And the service is developed in `Golang` language.

It will cover the following technical points:

*   Integrate Consul with Golang application for service registration
*   Integrate Consul with Golang application for service discovery
*   Configure and Run the microservices with Docker(docker-compose)

As you can see, this post will cover several critical concepts and interesting tools. I will do a quick and brief introduction of them.

*   **Cloud-Native**: this is another buzzword in the software industry. One of the key attributes of Cloud-Native application is `containerized`. To be considered cloud native, an application must be `infrastructure agnostic` and use containers. Containers provide applications the ability to run as a stand-alone environment able to move in and out of the cloud and have no dependencies on any certain cloud provider.
    
*   **Service Registration and Service Discovery**: in the microservices application, each service needs to call other services. In order to make a request, your service needs to know the network address of a service instance. In a cloud-based microservices application, the network location is dynamically assigned. So your application needs a service discovery mechanism. On the other hand, the service registry acts as a database storing the available service instances.
    
*   **Consul**: Consul is the tool we used in this demo application for service registry and discovery. Consul is a member in `CNCF(Cloud Native Computing Foundation)`. I will try to write a post to analyze its source code in the future.
    
*   **Docker-compose**: is a tool to run multi-container applications on Docker. It allows different containers can communicate with each other. In this post, I will show you how to use it as well.
    

All the code and config file can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/baoqger/service-discovery-demo), please checkout the `service-discovery` branch for this post’s demo.

### [](#Service-registry-and-discovery-demo "Service registry and discovery demo")Service registry and discovery demo

To explain service registry and discovery, I will run a simple `helloworld` server and a client which keeps sending requests to the server every 10 seconds. The demo `helloworld` server will register itself in `Consul`, and this process is just service registry. On the other side, before the client sends a request to the server, it will first send a request to `Consul` and find the address of the server. This process is just service discovery. OK, let’s show some code.

```
package main  
  
import (  
	"fmt"  
	"log"  
	"net/http"  
	"os"  
	"strconv"  
  
	consulapi "github.com/hashicorp/consul/api"  
)  
  
func main() {  
	serviceRegistryWithConsul()  
	log.Println("Starting Hello World Server...")  
	http.HandleFunc("/helloworld", helloworld)  
	http.HandleFunc("/check", check)  
	http.ListenAndServe(getPort(), nil)  
}  
  
func serviceRegistryWithConsul() {  
	config := consulapi.DefaultConfig()  
	consul, err := consulapi.NewClient(config)  
	if err != nil {  
		log.Println(err)  
	}  
  
	serviceID := "helloworld-server"  
	port, \_ := strconv.Atoi(getPort()\[1:len(getPort())\])  
	address := getHostname()  
  
	registration := &consulapi.AgentServiceRegistration{  
		ID:      serviceID,  
		Name:    "helloworld-server",  
		Port:    port,  
		Address: address,  
		Check: &consulapi.AgentServiceCheck{  
			HTTP:     fmt.Sprintf("http://%s:%v/check", address, port),  
			Interval: "10s",  
			Timeout:  "30s",  
		},  
	}  
  
	regiErr := consul.Agent().ServiceRegister(registration)  
  
	if regiErr != nil {  
		log.Printf("Failed to register service: %s:%v ", address, port)  
	} else {  
		log.Printf("successfully register service: %s:%v", address, port)  
	}  
}  
  
func helloworld(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {  
	log.Println("helloworld service is called.")  
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)  
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello world.")  
}  
  
func check(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {  
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)  
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Consul check")  
}  
  
func getPort() (port string) {  
	port = os.Getenv("PORT")  
	if len(port) == 0 {  
		port = "8080"  
	}  
	port = ":" + port  
	return  
}  
  
func getHostname() (hostname string) {  
	hostname, \_ = os.Hostname()  
	return  
}  
```
##### [](#server-go "server.go")**`server.go`**

The above `server.go` file contains many codes, but most of them are easy, and just for setting up the server and handling the request.

The interesting part is inside function `serviceRegistryWithConsul`. Consul provides APIs to register service by configuring the necessary information. For now, we can focus on two fields, the first one is `ID` which is unique for each service and we also use it for search the target service in the discovery process. The second one is `Check`, which means `health check`. Consul provides this helpful functionality. In the real microservices application, each service may have multiple instances to handle the increased requests when the concurrency is high, this is called `scalability`. But some instances may go down or throw exceptions, in service discovery we want to filter these instances out. Health check in Consul is just for this purpose. I will show you how to do that in the [next post](https://baoqger.github.io/2020/12/30/golang-load-balancing-fabio/).
```
package main  
  
import (  
	"fmt"  
	"io/ioutil"  
	"net/http"  
	"time"  
  
	consulapi "github.com/hashicorp/consul/api"  
)  
  
var url string  
  
func main() {  
	serviceDiscoveryWithConsul()  
	fmt.Println("Starting Client.")  
	var client = &http.Client{  
		Timeout: time.Second \* 30,  
	}  
	callServerEvery(10\*time.Second, client)  
}  
  
func serviceDiscoveryWithConsul() {  
	config := consulapi.DefaultConfig()  
	consul, error := consulapi.NewClient(config)  
	if error != nil {  
		fmt.Println(error)  
	}  
	services, error := consul.Agent().Services()  
	if error != nil {  
		fmt.Println(error)  
	}  
  
	service := services\["helloworld-server"\]  
	address := service.Address  
	port := service.Port  
	url = fmt.Sprintf("http://%s:%v/helloworld", address, port)  
}  
  
func hello(t time.Time, client \*http.Client) {  
	response, err := client.Get(url)  
	if err != nil {  
		fmt.Println(err)  
		return  
	}  
	body, \_ := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)  
	fmt.Printf("%s. Time is %v\\n", body, t)  
}  
  
func callServerEvery(d time.Duration, client \*http.Client) {  
	for x := range time.Tick(d) {  
		hello(x, client)  
	}  
}  
  
```
##### [](#client-go "client.go")**`client.go`**

Similarly, in the `client.go` file, the only key part is `serviceDiscoveryWithConsul` function. Based on the Consul APIs, we can find out all the services. With the target service id (in this demo is `helloworld-server`) which is set in the registration part, we can easily find out the address.

The above parts show how to do the service registry and discovery in a completed demo. It makes use of Consul APIs a lot, I didn’t give too many explanations on that, since you can find out more detailed information in the document.

In the next section, I will show you how to run this demo application in a Cloud-Native way based on Docker and Docker-compose.

### [](#Containerization "Containerization")Containerization

First let’s create Dockerfile for the server as following:

```
FROM golang:1.14.1\-alpine  
  
RUN apk update && apk upgrade && apk add --no-cache bash git  
  
RUN go get github.com/hashicorp/consul/api  
  
ENV SOURCES /go/src/github.com/baoqger/service-discovery-demo/  
COPY . ${SOURCES}  
  
RUN cd ${SOURCES}server/ && CGO\_ENABLED=0 go build  
  
ENV CONSUL\_HTTP\_ADDR localhost:8500  
  
WORKDIR ${SOURCES}server/  
CMD ${SOURCES}server/server  
  
```
##### [](#Dockerfile-for-server-go "Dockerfile for server.go")**`Dockerfile` for server.go**

This part is straightforward, if you don’t understand some of the commands used here please check the Docker’s manual.

I will not show the Dockerfile for the client any more, since it’s nearly the same as the above one. But you can find it in this [github repo](https://github.com/baoqger/service-discovery-demo).

Now we have both server and client running in containers. We need add the Consul into this application as well, and connect these 3 containers together. We do this with Docker-compose.

Docker-compose is driven by the `yml` file. In our case, it goes as following:

```
version: '2'  
  
services:   
  consul:  
    image: consul:0.8.3  
    ports:  
      \- "8500:8500"  
    networks:  
      \- my-net  
        
  helloworld-server:  
    build:  
      context: .  
      dockerfile: server/Dockerfile  
    image: helloworld-server:1.0.1  
    environment:   
      \- CONSUL\_HTTP\_ADDR=consul:8500  
    depends\_on:  
      \- consul  
    networks:  
      \- my-net  
  
  helloworld-client:  
    build:  
      context: .  
      dockerfile: client/Dockerfile  
    image: helloworld-client:1.0.1  
    environment:   
      \- CONSUL\_HTTP\_ADDR=consul:8500   
    depends\_on:  
      \- consul  
      \- helloworld-server  
    networks:  
      \- my-net  
  
networks:  
  my-net:  
    driver: bridge  
    
```
There are several points need to mention about docker-compose usages:

*   **networks**: we define a network called `my-net`, and use it in all of the 3 services to make them can talk with each other.
*   **environment**: we can set up the environment variable in this part. In our case, both server and client need to send requests to Consul for registry and discovery, right? You can check the server and client file, we didn’t set the Consul address explicitly. Since Consul do it in an implicit way, it will get the value from the environment variable named `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR`. We set it up with `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=consul:8500`.
*   **docker-compose up**: this is the command all you need to launch the application. Another helpful command is `docker-compose build` which is used to build the image defined in the yml file. Of course, `docker-compose down` can stop the containers when you want to leave the application.

Everything is setted up, you can verify the result both in the terminal and Consul UI as following:
